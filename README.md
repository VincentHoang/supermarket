# supermarket

Simple maven project, so you can import straight into an IDE (I used Intellij)<br/>
To compile run "mvn clean install"

I am not sure how one would change the pricing strategy, so I left it as a csv string: <br/>
e.g. <br/>
A,50,3,100 <br/>
translates to: Item=A, UnitPrice=50, SpecialPrice=3for100 <br/>
